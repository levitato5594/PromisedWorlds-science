        	default = It appears that the Kerbal upstairs forgot to give this place meaning. Please report this issue to the dev team.
		
		////////////////////// SURFACE ////////////////////
		
		// ------------------- Debdeb -------------------
		DebdebSrfLanded = What a day to have eyes. \n\n...And, there they go.
		
		// ------------------- Charr -------------------
		CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = You are not sure how you landed here. Best not to think about it too hard.
		CharrSrfLandedHotCraters =  You admire the fiery crater center. Meanwhile, your craft melts into the ground like a microwaved butter tower.
		CharrSrfLandedMidlands = Glowing bands of iron flow down the endless craters into their soft, gooey centers. You wish the Kerbolar System had a lava planet this epic (sorry, Moho).
		CharrSrfLandedHighlands = The metal beneath your craft glows a soft orange. It reminds you of hot summer days, campfires, and orange kerbsicles.
		CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = An ocean of fire flows over the horizon and out of sight. It is truly a gorgeous sight.
		
		// ------------------- Ovin -------------------
		OvinSrfLandedLowlands = You are deep in Ovin's gravity well -- AKA, your spacecraft's new, permanent home.
		OvinSrfLandedMidlands = The ground has been pulverized into an endless expanse of sand, dust, and other small, flat-ish things.
		OvinSrfLandedHighlands = You marvel at the gravity-smoothed landscape fracturing off into the unknown. It is a beautiful desolation.
		OvinSrfLandedMountains = How Ovin has mountains under such immense pressure is a mystery to you. How you plan to leave is also a mystery.
		OvinSrfLandedNedzerfjord = Nedzerfjord was named after the famous Kerben Nezder, who died of crushed legs after trying to carry too many snacks.
		OvinSrfLandedValleyofDespair = Welcome to the Valley of Despair, named as such because...well, look at it.
		OvinSrfLandedGulfofHairy = The Gulf of Hairy is a massive canyon that looks like a jagged strand of hair from space. It is said that any Kerbal who sees it will  grow a magical blonde beard.
		OvinSrfLandedDustyCrater = The spacecraft sinks slightly into the soft regolith of the crater, making you wonder what would happen if Ovin had quicksand. Let us hope it does not.
		OvinSrfLandedHefftyCliffs = There is rock bottom, and then there is Heffty Cliffs bottom. It is said that those who reach rock bottom and start digging may find themselves here.
		OvinSrfLandedGreatNorthernRift = The Great Northern Rift is a massive ravine second only to the Great Southern Rift. We believe it was formed in a rare Ovin superquake.
		OvinSrfLandedGreatSouthernRift = The Great Southern Rift is the most dangerous rift in the Debdeb System. Many say it is the maw of The Kraken, as what goes in does not come back out.
		OvinSrfLandedLesserNorthernRift = The Lesser Northern Rift is the Greater Northern Rift's smaller, younger cousin. It is volatile and subject to sudden edge collapses.
		OvinSrfLandedVinitaFissure = Named after the late Vinita Kera, this fissure borders an enormous mountain range, making it an alluring but dangerous natural wonder.
		
		//------------------- GURDAMMA ----------------------
		GurdammaSrfLandedDeepOceans = Your craft groans under the tremendous pressure. You realize this is Kerbal Space Program and not Kerbal Submarine Program, right?
		GurdammaSrfLandedOceans = Glowing globs of organic protoplasm drift past the craft. Hopefully you're not contaminating anything.
		GurdammaSrfLandedCraterLakes = The water enveloping the ship is a gorgeous, tropical teal color. If it weren't for all the slime, this would be an excellent place for a beach getaway.
		GurdammaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is damp and sandy. Rock outcroppings and patches of minerals extend toward the horizon.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMidlands = You feel like you're back home, lost in one of Kerbin's deserts. The massive moon and rings overhead is a reminder of how alien this planet really is.
		GurdammaSrfLandedHighlands = Moisture collects on the sides of the craft. Fortunately, all our space parts are carefully engineered to be immune to rust. If only the same was true for unscheduled disassemblies... 
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountains = Soupy clouds meander across the sun soaked sky as you admire Gurdamma from its highest vantage points. 
		GurdammaSrfLandedVolcanoes = You peer into the smoldering caldera. The smoldering caldera peers back.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountBogue = Mount Bogue was named after the famous Kerbal videographer, Bogue Kerbark. It is said the mountain's height equals his subscriber count. 
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenLowlands = Volcanic dust litters the erosion-marked rock like seasoning on a very dry pizza crust.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenHighlands = Volcanic dust swirls in the highland wind. A small ash devil snakes past the craft before disintegrating into grey smoke.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenMountains = Smoke wafts by the ship, threatening to clog its instruments.
		GurdammaSrfLandedShankastRiver = Ahhh...what a calm place! Other than the giant protoplanetary disk, actively forming moon, and the severe volcanic activity, that is. Maybe it isn't so calm...
		GurdammaSrfLandedTealRiver = The current is slow, but the water is thick and heavy. At least the color is pretty. Otherwise, ew.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMylonRiver = Named after the flowing fabric used to manufacture Kerbal spacesuits, the Mylon River is a beautiful but smelly waterway.
		GurdammaSrfLandedFaultlines = Being a continental proto-Kerbin, it comes as no surprise to you that Gurdamma has tectonic activity. You just hope that activity doesn't decide to happen now.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenFaultlines = What's worse than being next to an active fault line? Being next to an active fault line downwind of an active volcano.
		GurdammaSrfLandedFloodedFaultlines = You wonder how big a Gurdamma tsunami would be combined with Donk's immense tidal pull. You decide it's better not to entertain the idea.

		// ------------------- DONK -------------------

		DonkSrfLandedLavaLakes = You contemplate how you managed to land on a lava lake. While impressive, it's probably time to get going now.
		DonkSrfLandedBasaltBasins = Heat waves rise from the dark, fractured surface. This would be a great place to toast a snack!
		DonkSrfLandedMares = The landscape reminds you of the first pictures Kerbinauts took on the Mun, except it's enveloped by an exosphere of protoplanetary fumes. Epic!
		DonkSrfLandedMidlands = Boulders and basaltic shards stretch off into the tan-hued unknown.
		 
		DonkSrfLandedHighlands = Boulder clumps and chaotic rock formations dominate the highlands of this crater-infested world.
		DonkSrfLandedMountains = You're a little confused why this location is considered a mountain. To you, it looks more like a cratered mound jutting up from the surrounding land. Maybe the surveyor team had one too many snacks while writing their biome report.
		DonkSrfLandedCraters = This is it: the quintessential moon experience! Like snowflakes, every crater is unique. Perhaps you can make this one yours.
		DonkSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Only a fraction of Kerbinauts have visited the Mun's poles. Just wait until they hear about you!
		DonkSrfLandedPolarMidlands = Boulders and basaltic shards stretch off into the tan-hued unknown. Meanwhile, Donk's terminator lazily loops around the pole.
		DonkSrfLandedPolarHighlands = For a newly-formed, tidally-stressed moon, it sure is cold up here.

		// ------------------- GUP -------------------
		
		GupSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The terrain slopes away from you parabolically on both sides. Or is it linearly? You regret leaving your leveler tool at home.
		GupSrfLandedSlopes = It's difficult to tell which way gravity is pulling you and how fast. 
		GupSrfLandedMidlands = It's unclear why Gup has midlands but no lowlands or highlands. Anyway, look how beautiful Gurdamma is from here!
		GupSrfLandedPoles = You slowly spin around with the rotation of the moon. Round and round. Round, and round. Whee!

		// ------------------- LAPAT -------------------
		
		LapatSrfLandedDeepOceans = The ocean floor is warm, dark, and spotted with hydrothermic vents. Some are active; most are not.
		LapatSrfLandedOceans = The view outside is maroon with rust and purple organic compounds. Every so often, a plump, alien fish glides past the viewport.
		LapatSrfLandedShores = Rusty waves lap the shore, carrying alien sea grass with them.
		LapatSrfLandedLowlands = Wild, twisting mountains loom in the distance, each teeming with plant life. A plump, colorful, dinosaur-like creature bumbles by your craft. It looks friendly.
		LapatSrfLandedMidlands = The landscape is a bizarre mix of mesa, mountain, cratered wasteland, and lively forest. You wish Duna was this exciting.
		LapatSrfLandedHighlands = The air is getting thin, as is the plant life and rust. A labyrinth of mountains, craters, and trees branches off into the distance.
		LapatSrfLandedMountains = The atmosphere is thin enough to just barely see the stars. Meanwhile, Debdeb's protoplanetary disk shines brightly through the intermittent clouds. 
		LapatSrfLandedIcyCliffs = It is said that Duna's ice shelves prevent explorers from visiting the edge of the world. Staring at the towering cliffs before you, you wonder what secrets lie beyond their walls.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyLowlands = It is chilly outside. The rusty deserts of the mainland have been replaced by endless snowdrifts.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyHighlands = It is cold and windy outside. A large snow devil races by as you try to keep the craft warm.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyHighlands = It is snowy and frigid outside. Beyond the occasional ice bird nest, the landscape is dull and lifeless.

		// ------------------- GLUMO -------------------
		GlumoSrfLanded = Uhhhh...\nWell...since you made it this far, you might as well keep going, right?

		// ------------------- NOJ -------------------
		
		NojSrfLandedLowlands = These are Noj's lowlands. They are lands that are low, but not so low that you vanish into a chasm and are never seen again.
		NojSrfLandedMidlands = These are Noj's midlands. They are the lands in the middle of the lowlands and highlands. Amazing, right?!
		NojSrfLandedHighlands = These are Noj's highlands. They are lands that are high, but not so high that you vanish into space and reenter orbit around Glumo. 
		NojSrfLandedEquator = Your craft sinks slightly into the mound of accreted ring dust. You can see the lowlands, midlands, highlands, and maybe even your house from here.

		// ------------------- SHANA -------------------

		ShanaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is smooth, rocky, and dusty all at the same time. You aren't really sure what's going on, actually. 
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkLowlands = The ground is...uh...hmm. You strain your eyes but can't see anything in the darkness.
		ShanaSrfLandedMidlands = There's not a whole lot going on here. Rocky crags race off across Shana's surface in all directions, but there isn't anything particularly interesting to see.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkMidlands = You write down your observations of the situation.\n\nDark. It is very dark. Note to self: bring flashlight next time.
		ShanaSrfLandedHighlands = Glumo's rings shine brightly above the dull, rocky surface.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkHighlands = You stare into the darkness, trying to make a witty observation about the moon's surface. Regrettably, giving Kerbals night vision never left the R&D stage.
		ShanaSrfLandedMountains = The other moons of the Glumo System shine brightly in the sky. Below, the brownish, greyish, orangish, yellowish surface of Shana lays unfazed.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkMountains = It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a Krue.
		ShanaSrfLandedPoles = What fun is visiting the poles if there isn't any snow? Anyway, onto the next destination, please.
		ShanaSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = A jagged row of mountains advances along the equator and out of sight. Loose gravel and dust shifts beneath the craft.
		
		// ------------------- KLEID -------------------
		
		KleidSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is rocky. You wonder how much money a Kleid rock would go for back home.
		KleidSrfLandedMidlands = The ground is pebbly. You spot a perfectly round pebble near the craft and immediately regret not bringing your golf club.
		KleidSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is fragmented. This would be a bad place to drop a screw while trying to repair the craft.
		KleidSrfLandedMountains = The ground is jagged. You make a mental note: don't let the Kerbinauts outside in just their space socks.
		KleidSrfLandedPoles = There is not much going on. You wonder if there is a mohohole somewhere around here.
		KleidSrfLandedCanyons = These trenches put the Dres canyon to shame. Basically, there is no longer any good reason to visit Dres.\n\nI wonder if Straten Kerblitz would be able to bridge this.

		// ------------------- MERBEL -------------------

		MerbelSrfLandedDeepSeas = BRRRRrRRRrRr
		MerbelSrfLandedSeas = COLD COLD COLD WHY ARE WE DOWN HERE--?
		MerbelSrfLandedShallowSeas = Little bubbles jiggle through the brackish water as they rise to the surface. Meanwhile, the craft jiggles through the water because it is cold.
		MerbelSrfLandedCoasts = Deep blue water laps at the stony, grey-blue shore. Lonely flakes of snow settle and absorb into the waves.
		MerbelSrfLandedLowlands = The air is dangerously cold from the humidity. Emulsified water droplets freeze on contact with the craft.
		MerbelSrfLandedMidlands = The wind comes and goes, showering the craft with snowflakes and ice fleks. 
		MerbelSrfLandedHighlands = The wind is frustratingly cold at this altitude. The craft groans in anguish at the extreme temperatures.
		MerbelSrfLandedMountains = Thin air? Check. Deathly cold temperatures? Check. Scary ice monster about to eat us? Let's hope not.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarDeepSeas = BRRRRrRRRrRr\n\nGET US OUT OF HEREEEEEEE
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarSeas = COLD COLD COLD WHY ARE WE DOWN HERE--?\nWHYYYYYYY?????
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarShallowSeas = Little bubbles collect into an air pool underneath the polar ice. You hope that doesn't mean the craft has a leak somewhere.
		
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarCoasts = It is not clear where the coast ends and the ice sheets begin.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The continent is locked underneath at least 10 meters of ice. Us too, if we stay here.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarMidlands = Snowdrifts and snow devils slam the craft as the wind tumbles toward the lowlands. 
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarHighlands = The craft buckles and shakes in the extreme environment.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarMountains = Take us out of this frozen whirlwind, or else...uh...\n\n...or else we'll eat the rest of the SNACKS. 
		
		// ------------------- DIROS -------------------
		
		DirosSrfLanded = The ground is jagged, cratered, and generally unpleasant to land on. Overhead, Jut performs a mesmerizing orbital dance. Let's hope it doesn't get pulled into a collision trajectory with us.

		// ------------------- JUT -------------------

		JutSrfLanded = We're basically on a more battered version of Gilly. It's a moon...of a moon...of a planet with many other significant moons. Yeah...this thing's orbit definitely isn't stable. Let's get out of here.

		// ------------------- AXOD -------------------
		AxodSrfLanded = AUGHHHH AUGHHHHHHHHH A--\n\n*Inhales*\n\n--UGHHHHHHH

		// ------------------- UMOD -------------------

		UmodSrfLandedLowlands = The ground has an almost taffy-like appearance, stretching and folding between the rocks.
		UmodSrfLandedMidlands = The ground has stretch marks. Umod's collision must have been sudden, unpleasant, and a major contributor of its mass.
		UmodSrfLandedHighlands = These mounds of pyroclastic rock extend high above Umod's surface--no doubt a result of its traumatic collision event. 
		UmodSrfLandedMountains = We are at the tippy top of the largest pyroclastic mounds ever discovered. Science is awesome!
		UmodSrfLandedCraters = It's odd how few craters there are. Maybe Umod only cooled after most of the collision fragments rejoined its mass?
		UmodSrfLandedCraterPeaks = These impacts must have been especially violent to generate these peaks. Yikes!

		// ------------------- MESMA -------------------

		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = A labyrinth of trenches towers over the ship. According to Kerbal folklore, The Kraken wanders these cosmic halls, searching for tasty playthings. 
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = The flat, slick terrain is perfect for ring gazing.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = The ground is rocky with a touch of forbidden ice-dirt sorbet.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = The ground slopes down toward the icy wastelands below. 
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = This is one of the mountains of all time. Can we visit the canyons next?

		// ------------------- OMASA -------------------

		OmasaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is unusually soft, like wet clay or a muddy sponge. You contemplate going outside and making a mud castle, but you decide against it.
		OmasaSrfLandedMidlands = The ground is light and crunchy, like your favorite candy bar. You feel your stomach rumble.
		OmasaSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is airy but firm. Far below you, massive concentric rings circumnavigate Omasa's massive craters. You wonder if they were formed naturally, or you're not alone after all.
		OmasaSrfLandedPeaks = The ground slopes sharply toward the cratered lowlands just a few hundred meters from the ship. You can see Glumo's rings very clearly up here.
		
		// ------------------- ROSH -------------------

		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is black and crunchy. It reminds you of charcoal, but there are no trees nearby to produce it.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = Everything is tinged grey. It's a little depressing, honestly. Can we go somewhere else? 
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The landscape is chalky. Dust clings to the ship as it contacts the ground.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = Peaks...\nUh...what peaks? "Big hill" would be pushing it. I guess they mean peaks as in "jagged", not "mountain"?
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = They say Rosh's mare reminds Kerbals of onions. I, unfortunately, have to disagree. Like...what? Who comes up with this stuff?
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = Named after Kerina Nezder, Mount Nezder is the tallest lump of stuff on Rosh. It is far from being the tallest mountain in the Debdeb System, though.
		
		// ------------------- DORAU -------------------
		
		DorauSrfLandedShores = Liquid nitrogen gently washes over the shoreline. You know, the shore might be cold, but in comparison to the oceans, it's a tropical paradise.
		DorauSrfLandedLowlands = The coasts are a cloudy wasteland of ice, rock, and the occasional snowstorm. They are a perfect balance between gloomy and cozy.
		DorauSrfLandedMidlands = Jagged animal stripes of rock and mineral veins carve elaborate patterns through the ice. Your eyes trace the paths as they vanish off into the snowy haze.
		DorauSrfLandedHighlands = Shimmering clouds of ice shards drift by, showering the craft in frozen bits and bobs. Sunlight refracts through the airborne crystals and cascades onto the slopes as mini rainbows.
		DorauSrfLandedNitrogenSeas = You try to share your thoughts, but your jaw is frozen shut, and you left your crowbar at home. Perhaps it's time to go elsewhere.

		// ------------------- BIS -------------------

		BisSrfLanded = You hope mission control lets you go outside; this place is EVA heaven!
		
		////////////////////// FLYING ////////////////////
		
		// ------------------- DEBDEB -------------------
		
		DebdebFlyingLow = You can see Debdeb's sunspots in great detail now. That is not a good thing.
		DebdebFlyingHigh = You take a quick glance at Debdeb's surface and instantly regret your decision.
		DebdebInSpaceLow = Radiation levels outside are approaching lethal levels.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = We are on a journey far from home, basking in the light of a million interstellar fireflies.

		// ------------------- CHARR -------------------
		
		CharrInSpaceLow = Charr's glowing surface stretches, folds, and flows in a mesmerizing fire dance.
		CharrInSpaceHigh = The surface is pockmarked, red, and inflamed--a bad case of space acne.

		// ------------------- OVIN -------------------

		OvinFlyingLow = You fight to keep the craft intact under the extreme gravity. The extreme gravity giggles at your puny efforts. 
		OvinFlyingHigh = The atmosphere wraps around your craft and tries to pull it down. Not far below, Ovin's smooth, teak surface is a siren's call.
		OvinInSpaceLow = Ovin's surface is flat as a pancake. If you descend, you will be too.
		OvinInSpaceHigh = Ovin is the god of wisdom and old age in ancient Kerbal mythology. Based on your travel preferences, it seems you don't wish to aquire either.

		// ------------------- GURDAMMA -------------------

		GurdammaFlyingLow = This is the ultimate interstellar adventure. You wish you could land, unfurl a beach umbrella, and lounge in Debdeb's alien sunbeams.
		GurdammaFlyingHigh = Far below, Gurdamma's crater lakes shimmer cheerfully. The young land fades in and out of view beneath the wispy clouds and volcanic ash trails.
		GurdammaInSpaceLow = It looks humid down there. If Gurdamma ever has a gnat infestation, I'm gonna cry.
		GurdammaInSpaceHigh = You can't help but marvel at how analogous Gurdamma, Donk, and Gup are to Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus. It's like you have traveled back in time.

		// ------------------- DONK -------------------

		DonkFlyingLow = Wispy tendrils of rock vapor and other carcinogenic fumes rise from cracks in the surface and dissipate into the omnipresent haze.  
		DonkFlyingHigh = A gentle wind lofts the craft as Donk's atmosphere escapes into space.
		DonkInSpaceLow = Like the Mun, Donk has mare, craters, lava, an atmosphere...\n\nOn second thought, maybe they aren't so similar after all.
		DonkInSpaceHigh = Donk glows a soft, golden color. It complements the cheery oranges and yellows of the protoplanetary disk well.

		// ------------------- GUP -------------------
		
		GupInSpaceLow = You know what would be cool? An EVA race around the equatorial ridge! First one to lap the moon wins the rest of the snacks.
		GupInSpaceHigh = Gup would make for a good skipping stone. \n...Too bad Gurdamma doesn't have a lake big enough to skip it.

		// ------------------- LAPAT -------------------

		LapatFlyingLow = Glowing yellow spores, whisps of cloud vapor, and flocks of fat alien birds glide by. Wow!
		LapatFlyingHigh = It's hard to tell from this altitude whether Lapat is just an atmospheric Duna or something more precious.
		LapatInSpaceLow = The surface is an awkward blend of deep reds, dirty oranges, cloudy whites, and sky blues.
		LapatInSpaceHigh = Duna? Is that you???
		
		// ------------------- GLUMO -------------------

		GlumoFlyingLow = It is frighteningly dark outside. Superbolt flashes illuminate a cloudscape far from the soothing blues and oranges in the upper decks.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Oranges, blues, and the mysterious color in between swirl, combine, and separate around the craft. So pretty!
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Purple, orange, and blue are the last colors you would expect to see together, yet here, they just work. Who knew a gas giant could be so charming?
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Glumo is such an amazing planet. It's too bad someone already put a ring on it.
		
		// ------------------- NOJ -------------------
		
		NojInSpaceLow = Careful--that equatorial ridge means business!
		NojInSpaceHigh = On Kerbin, Noj is a famous brand of ice cream sandwich made from ground-up Minmus dust. You can see the resemblance.

		// ------------------- SHANA -------------------

		ShanaInSpaceLow = There doesn't seem to be a whole lot going on down there. If it wasn't for the ridge, Shana would just be a boring, brown ball.
		ShanaInSpaceHigh = Shana's equatorial ridge has a unique flow to it. It seems to be pulling the surrounding terrain clockwise around the moon.\n\n...Or is it counterclockwise?

		// ------------------- KLEID -------------------

		KleidInSpaceLow = Kleid's canyons snake across its surface, carving intricate paths into the stone. 
		KleidInSpaceHigh = Astronomers once renamed Kleid to Heartbreak to protest the reclassification of Eeloo to "dwarf planet". It remains Heartbreak to many today.
		
		// ------------------- MERBEL -------------------
		
		MerbelFlyingLow = There is a lots of packed snow down there. Do you think we can make a quick stop for shaved ice? I brought mango syrup!
		MerbelFlyingHigh = There are snow worlds, and then there's MERBEL. Just look at those deep blue waves and stone-cold icecaps...
		MerbelInSpaceLow = It's amazing that Merbel has clouds. You half expect them to see them flash-freeze into spongy vapor bricks and plummet to the ground. 
		MerbelInSpaceHigh = Mmmm...blue raspberry sorbet. I hope those oceans taste as good as they look.

		// ------------------- DIROS -------------------

		DirosInSpaceLow = The surface is so cratered, it's hard to tell how many craters went into the creation of one misshapen divot.
		DirosInSpaceHigh = Huh.\nYou know, if you squint, Diros kind of looks like Moho. 

		// ------------------- JUT -------------------

		JutInSpaceLow = The surface is covered in big craters, small craters, and the countless other crater descriptions in between.
		JutInSpaceHigh = You struggle to determine whether you're looking at Jut or Gilly. Did you take a wrong turn?

		// ------------------- AXOD -------------------
		
		AxodFlyingLow = The wind roars outside as you traverse the lower cloud decks. You suspect the craft will be torn asunder long before it reaches crush depth.
		AxodFlyingHigh = Creamy blues and whites race by, curling and swirling into blueberry parfait goodness.
		AxodInSpaceLow = Lightning flashes pierce through the cloud bands. The white bands ride high, revealing frigid cyan maelstroms deeper in the interior. 
		AxodInSpaceHigh = Axod is Glumo's forgotten cousin. With muted colors, smaller rings, and a sequence of dim, muddy moons, many believe that visiting the planet is waste of taxpayer funds. Fortunately, more enlightened minds run our space program. 
		
		// ------------------- UMOD -------------------
		
		UmodInSpaceLow = The surface is dimpled but not cratered. There are a lot of crazy color patterns going on down there.
		UmodInSpaceHigh = Umod has the texture of a butterball and the appearance of a butterball accidentally dropped into a rocket engine.

		// ------------------- MESMA -----------------

		MesmaInSpaceLow = It's amazing how a moon can so smooth and so fractured at the same time. Mesma would be an awesome place to go skiing.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = Mesma looks like a chunk of desert that got left in the sun too long. Since ice plains are technically deserts, this assessment isn't really  far from the truth.
		
		// ------------------- OMASA -----------------
		
		OmasaInSpaceLow = Omasa's craters remind you of the whirlpools ancient Kerbals decorated maps of Kerbin with. Hopefully that's just a coincidence.
		OmasaInSpaceHigh = The surface is lumpy in some places and stepped in others. How strange.

		// ------------------- ROSH -----------------

		RoshFlyingLow = The surface is very, very close. I'm just going to close my eyes and hope you've got this under control.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The surface is close, and the atmosphere is thin. Be careful, please!
		RoshInSpaceLow = It's a gloomy world down there. Next time, let's bring a few buckets of paint to help spruce things up. Maybe solar-powered Khristmas lights, too!
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Rosh looks like a stone-flavored gumball. That's about all you can tell from this height.

		// ------------------- DORAU -----------------
		
		DorauFlyingLow = Flying conditions are favorable right now. Thick atmosphere? Low gravity? All right!
		DorauFlyingHigh = A feeling of calm washes over you. It's so peaceful out here.
		DorauInSpaceLow = A large polar low circles over one of Dorau's nitrogen seas. It is hypnotizingly calm.
		DorauInSpaceHigh = A comically large atmosphere rests atop the cold, yellow-grey plains of Dorau. Soft as a lullaby, it calls to you, beckoning you to sleep.

		// ------------------- BIS -----------------
		
		BisInSpaceLow = It's hard to see the surface. Maybe we should send someone out on EVA.
		BisInSpaceHigh = It's too dim to discern any noteworthy features. We need to get closer.
