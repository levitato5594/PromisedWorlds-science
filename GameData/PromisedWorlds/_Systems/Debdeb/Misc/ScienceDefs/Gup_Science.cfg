	{
		GupSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The terrain slopes away from you parabolically on both sides. Or is it linearly? You regret leaving your leveler tool at home.
		GupSrfLandedSlopes = It's difficult to tell which way gravity is pulling you and how fast.
		GupSrfLandedMidlands = It's unclear why Gup has midlands but no lowlands or highlands. Anyway, look how beautiful Gurdamma is from here!
		GupSrfLandedPoles = You slowly spin around with the rotation of the moon. Round and round. Round, and round. Whee!
		GupInSpaceLow = You know what would be cool? An EVA race around the equatorial ridge! First one to lap the moon wins the rest of the snacks.
		GupInSpaceHigh = Gup would make for a good skipping stone. \n...Too bad Gurdamma doesn't have a lake big enough to skip it.
