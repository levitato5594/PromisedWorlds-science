	@RESULTS
	{
		GurdammaSrfLanded = You've made it to Gurdamma! Time to explore!
		GurdammaSrfLandedDeepOceans = Your craft groans under the tremendous pressure. You realize this is Kerbal Space Program and not Kerbal Submarine Program, right?
		GurdammaSrfLandedOceans = Glowing globs of organic protoplasm drift past the craft. Hopefully you're not contaminating anything.
		GurdammaSrfLandedCraterLakes = The water enveloping the ship is a gorgeous, tropical teal color. If it weren't for all the slime, this would be an excellent place for a beach getaway.
		GurdammaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is damp and sandy. Rock outcroppings and patches of minerals extend toward the horizon.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMidlands = You feel like you're back home, lost in one of Kerbin's deserts. The massive moon and rings overhead is a reminder of how alien this planet really is.
		GurdammaSrfLandedHighlands = Moisture collects on the sides of the craft. Fortunately, all our space parts are carefully engineered to be immune to rust. If only the same was true for unscheduled disassemblies...
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountains = Soupy clouds meander across the sun soaked sky as you admire Gurdamma from its highest vantage points.
		GurdammaSrfLandedVolcanoes = You peer into the smoldering caldera. The smoldering caldera peers back.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountBogue = Mount Bogue was named after the famous Kerbal videographer, Bogue Kerbark. It is said the mountain's height equals his subscriber count.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenLowlands = Volcanic dust litters the erosion-marked rock like seasoning on a very dry pizza crust.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenHighlands = Volcanic dust swirls in the highland wind. A small ash devil snakes past the craft before disintegrating into grey smoke.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenMountains = Smoke wafts by the ship, threatening to clog its instruments.
		GurdammaSrfLandedShankastRiver = Ahhh...what a calm place! Other than the giant protoplanetary disk, actively forming moon, and the severe volcanic activity, that is. Maybe it isn't so calm...
		GurdammaSrfLandedTealRiver = The current is slow, but the water is thick and heavy. At least the color is pretty. Otherwise, ew.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMylonRiver = Named after the flowing fabric used to manufacture Kerbal spacesuits, the Mylon River is a beautiful but smelly waterway.
		GurdammaSrfLandedFaultlines = Being a continental proto-Kerbin, it comes as no surprise to you that Gurdamma has tectonic activity. You just hope that activity doesn't decide to happen now.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenFaultlines = What's worse than being next to an active fault line? Being next to an active fault line downwind of an active volcano.
		GurdammaSrfLandedFloodedFaultlines = You wonder how big a Gurdamma tsunami would be combined with Donk's immense tidal pull. You decide it's better not to entertain the idea.
		GurdammaSplashed = You're reminded of splashing back to Kerbin... wait. This is Gurdamma. You're reminded you're light years from home. Take it easy.
		GurdammaFlyingLow = This is the ultimate interstellar adventure. You wish you could land, unfurl a beach umbrella, and lounge in Debdeb's alien sunbeams.
		GurdammaFlyingHigh = Far below, Gurdamma's crater lakes shimmer cheerfully. The young land fades in and out of view beneath the wispy clouds and volcanic ash trails.
		GurdammaInSpaceLow = It looks humid down there. If Gurdamma ever has a gnat infestation, I'm gonna cry.
		GurdammaInSpaceHigh = You can't help but marvel at how analogous Gurdamma, Donk, and Gup are to Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus. It's like you have traveled back in time.

	{
		GurdammaSrfLandedOceans = The ocean is thick and weird, but nonetheless, water.
		GurdammaSrfLandedLowlands = You feel like you're back home, but outside is nothing but a forming planet desolate of life. The lowlands bring you happiness however.
		GurdammaSrfLandedHighlands = You're back home, but see that it's only Gurdamma outside your suit. Sand-like dirt lay below your boots.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenLowlands = Gurdamma is nothing but a forming planet desolate of life. Theres also ash on the ground
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenHighlands = Theres also ash everywhere, everywhere there is ash.
		GurdammaSrfLandedCrater Lakes = You find yourself reminded of lakes on Kerbin. Although these are a bit thick and goopy. Might want to collect a sample.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountains = You take in the view, and you want to build a home.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Lowlands = The Ground is very dusty, black, soot-like. This is from Volcanoes nearby.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Highlands = The Volcanoes nearby have produced a soot that covers the ground.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Mountains = Some Volcanoes are nearby. It's very obvious what caused the black grains in the sand, along with the occasional Volcano-Formed Rocks.
		GurdammaSrfLandedVolcanoes = It's a bit up here. You sure you're alright? Drink some water!
		GurdammaSrfLandedMount Bogue = You’re reminded of the first astronauts that went to the Mun. Strangely enough, you also feel a presence.
		GurdammaSrfLandedShankast River = Just like home… except it’s really not and just desolate. You want to swim in the water of this river, but again, are reminded that it may be harmful for you.
		GurdammaSrfLandedTeal River = Just like home… except it’s really not and just desolate. You want to swim in the water of this river, but again, are reminded that it may be harmful for you.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMylon River = Just like home… except it’s really not and just desolate. You want to swim in the water of this river, but again, are reminded that it may be harmful for you.
		GurdammaSrfLandedFaultlines =  This is quite useful… Gurdamma has similar continental movement just like Kerbin. I wouldn’t want to stand here for much longer… Gurdamma’s Mantle is quite active.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Faultlines =  This is quite useful… Gurdamma has similar continental movement just like Kerbin. I wouldn’t want to stand here for much longer… Gurdamma’s Mantle is quite active.

	@RESULTS
	{
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Lowlands = The dirt here might be rich enough to grow plants with some dirt from home, however the atmosphere is absolutely not suitable for plants from Kerbin. You remind yourself you should seek out life here, but yet again are shut down by the fact that you are the only species in the galaxy… right?
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Midlands = There is a substantial amount of pulverized rock here, however, we might find a better consistency in the lowlands for possibly using it to feed our crops.
		Highlands = There is very little pulverized rock here, just very loose rubble. Maybe if we process it we might be able to make a fertilizer.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Faultlines = The ground is mixed with Ash from the Volcanoes. We can use this for fertilizer, might sell well back at home.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Mountains = The ground here might be rich enough to grow plants with some dirt from home, however the atmosphere is absolutely not suitable for plants from Kerbin. You remind yourself you should seek out life here, but yet again are shut down by the fact that you are the only species in the galaxy… right?
		GurdammaSrfLandedCrater Lakes = The material is sludge-like, but is also very viscous
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountains= There seems to be evidence of amino acids, although the scientists reminded you that life is complex and cannot form here for millions of more years.
