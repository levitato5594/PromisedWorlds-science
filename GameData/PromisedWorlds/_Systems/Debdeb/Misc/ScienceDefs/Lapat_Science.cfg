		LapatSrfLandedDeepOceans = The ocean floor is warm, dark, and spotted with hydrothermic vents. Some are active; most are not.
		LapatSrfLandedOceans = The view outside is maroon with rust and purple organic compounds. Every so often, a plump, alien fish glides past the viewport.
		LapatSrfLandedShores = Rusty waves lap the shore, carrying alien sea grass with them.
		LapatSrfLandedLowlands = Wild, twisting mountains loom in the distance, each teeming with plant life. A plump, colorful, dinosaur-like creature bumbles by your craft. It looks friendly.
		LapatSrfLandedMidlands = The landscape is a bizarre mix of mesa, mountain, cratered wasteland, and lively forest. You wish Duna was this exciting.
		LapatSrfLandedHighlands = The air is getting thin, as is the plant life and rust. A labyrinth of mountains, craters, and trees branches off into the distance.
		LapatSrfLandedMountains = The atmosphere is thin enough to just barely see the stars. Meanwhile, Debdeb's protoplanetary disk shines brightly through the intermittent clouds.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyCliffs = It is said that Duna's ice shelves prevent explorers from visiting the edge of the world. Staring at the towering cliffs before you, you wonder what secrets lie beyond their walls.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyLowlands = It is chilly outside. The rusty deserts of the mainland have been replaced by endless snowdrifts.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyHighlands = It is cold and windy outside. A large snow devil races by as you try to keep the craft warm.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyHighlands = It is snowy and frigid outside. Beyond the occasional ice bird nest, the landscape is dull and lifeless.
		LapatSplashed = You could be forgiven for thinking you'd just returned to Kerbin - until an alien fish swims by, snapping you out of the illusion.
		LapatFlyingLow = Glowing yellow spores, whisps of cloud vapor, and flocks of fat alien birds glide by. Wow!
		LapatFlyingHigh = It's hard to tell from this altitude whether Lapat is just an atmospheric Duna or something more precious.
		LapatInSpaceLow = The surface is an awkward blend of deep reds, dirty oranges, cloudy whites, and sky blues.
		LapatInSpaceHigh = Duna? Is that you???

		LapatInSpaceLow = Though peaceful and idyllic, the craters tell a story of Lapat's violent past.
		LapatInSpaceHigh = From high up, Lapat seems like an inverted ice cream sandwich - a layer of land between two enormous frozen caps.
