		// Two copies existed so both are included!
		DonkSrfLandedLavaLakes = You contemplate how you managed to land on a lava lake. While impressive, it's probably time to get going now.
		DonkSrfLandedBasaltBasins = Heat waves rise from the dark, fractured surface. This would be a great place to toast a snack!
		DonkSrfLandedMares = The landscape reminds you of the first pictures Kerbinauts took on the Mun, except it's enveloped by an exosphere of protoplanetary fumes. Epic!
		DonkSrfLandedMidlands = Boulders and basaltic shards stretch off into the tan-hued unknown.

		DonkSrfLandedHighlands = Boulder clumps and chaotic rock formations dominate the highlands of this crater-infested world.
		DonkSrfLandedMountains = You're a little confused why this location is considered a mountain. To you, it looks more like a cratered mound jutting up from the surrounding land. Maybe the surveyor team had one too many snacks while writing their biome report.
		DonkSrfLandedCraters = This is it: the quintessential moon experience! Like snowflakes, every crater is unique. Perhaps you can make this one yours.
		DonkSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Only a fraction of Kerbinauts have visited the Mun's poles. Just wait until they hear about you!
		DonkSrfLandedPolarMidlands = Boulders and basaltic shards stretch off into the tan-hued unknown. Meanwhile, Donk's terminator lazily loops around the pole.
		DonkSrfLandedPolarHighlands = For a newly-formed, tidally-stressed moon, it sure is cold up here.
		DonkSrfLanded = The thrills of landing on the Mun... wait. This is Donk. You're reminded you're light years away from home.

		//DonkSplashed = This definition has not yet been written. If you see this in game, please report it to the developers.

		DonkFlyingLow = Wispy tendrils of rock vapor and other carcinogenic fumes rise from cracks in the surface and dissipate into the omnipresent haze.
		DonkFlyingHigh = A gentle wind lofts the craft as Donk's atmosphere escapes into space.
		DonkInSpaceLow = Like the Mun, Donk has mare, craters, lava, an atmosphere...\n\nOn second thought, maybe they aren't so similar after all.
		DonkInSpaceHigh = Donk glows a soft, golden color. It complements the cheery oranges and yellows of the protoplanetary disk well.
		DonkInSpaceLow = You're reminded of the Mun. Oh... The Crew becomes lonely as They're reminded of life back on Kerbin
		DonkInSpaceHigh = You're amazed by Gurdamma's rings, but wonder if you will land on Donk.

		DonkSrfLandedLava Lakes = OUCH! Don't go near it.
		DonkSrfLandedBasalt Basins = The ground is very basalt like. It's a good idea to take a sample back home. Could be worth Billions of funds. It's probably useless.
		DonkSrfLandedMares = It's very flat. You take note of the situation around you.
		DonkSrfLandedMidlands = The Midlands of Donk give you a strange feeling, almost like you've been here before.
		DonkSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is very disturbed. You note the micro-meteroid impacts.
		DonkSrfLandedMountains = You find yourself urging to build a home here.
		DonkSrfLandedCraters = The edges of the craters are high above your head. You take note of the situation because Donk is starting to annoy you with how boring it is.
		DonkSrfLandedPolar Lowlands = The view from the polar lowlands is very stunning, you can see Gurdamma's rings from here, and the ground is weirdly softer.
		DonkSrfLandedPolar Midlands = You note the view from the polar midlands, as you can see DebDeb low in the sky.
		DonkSrfLandedPolar Highlands = You note the view from the polar highlands, and your current situation. DebDeb is low in the sky and makes you feel insignificant in this grand universe.

	{
		DonkSrfLandedLava Lakes = You try to take a sample, but your materials melt from the heat. You also almost melted. Drink some water.
		DonkSrfLandedBasalt Basins = You put the sample in a tube. One wonders how much it will be worth back on Kerbin. Not Mun, but Donk.
		DonkSrfLandedMares = It's very flat, so you tank a sample. It's just rock however and some basalt. You think of using it as Pepper for a snack later, but it's not Pepper, as the scientists reminded you.
		DonkSrfLandedMidlands = You take a sample from the Midlands of Donk. It's just basalt, nothing special really.
		DonkSrfLandedHighlands = You take a sample from the Highlands of Donk. It's just basalt. You smudge the sample with your fingers like a mote of dust to get a feel for it's texture.
		DonkSrfLandedMountains = You take a sample from the Mountains It's just basalt, however you look as to a way to transform the ground into a home.
		DonkSrfLandedCraters = You take a sample. It's just basalt, a little different however.
		DonkSrfLandedPolar Lowlands = You take a sample. It's just basalt, however quite cold, very cold.
		DonkSrfLandedPolar Midlands = You take a sample. It's just basalt, however its quite cold.
		DonkSrfLandedPolar Highlands = You take a sample. It's just basalt.
