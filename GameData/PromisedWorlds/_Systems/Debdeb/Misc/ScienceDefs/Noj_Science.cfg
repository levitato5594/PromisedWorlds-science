		NojSrfLandedLowlands = These are Noj's lowlands. They are lands that are low, but not so low that you vanish into a chasm and are never seen again.
		NojSrfLandedMidlands = These are Noj's midlands. They are the lands in the middle of the lowlands and highlands. Amazing, right?!
		NojSrfLandedHighlands = These are Noj's highlands. They are lands that are high, but not so high that you vanish into space and reenter orbit around Glumo.
		NojSrfLandedEquator = Your craft sinks slightly into the mound of accreted ring dust. You can see the lowlands, midlands, highlands, and maybe even your house from here.
		NojInSpaceLow = Careful--that equatorial ridge means business!
		NojInSpaceHigh = On Kerbin, Noj is a famous brand of ice cream sandwich made from ground-up Minmus dust. You can see the resemblance.
